Although the kernel provides the basic implementation for threads, application-level threads are based on BSD threads and the POSIX threading API. This API provides the application-level support needed to create and manage threads. In addition, Mac OS X implements several higher-level technologies that provide a more streamlined or sophisticated interface to the basic POSIX threads API.

 the thread runs in one of three main states: running, ready, or blocked.

Operation Objects and operation queue：
provide an easy way to add concurrency to your Cocoa applications without creating threads yourself. 

Run Loops：
A run loop is a piece of infrastructure used to manage events arriving asynchronously on a thread. A run loop is created for each thread automatically by the system, but that run loop must be configured before it can be used.
The infrastructure provided by both Cocoa and Carbon，handles the configuration of the main thread’s run loop for you automatically. 
A run loop works by monitoring one or more attached event sources.
If no events are present and ready to be handled, the run loop puts the thread to sleep.
Run loops make it possible to create long-lived threads, and to put those threads to sleep when there is nothing to do.
