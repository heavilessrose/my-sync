 * First of all, this doc is about UT(Unit Test), if you don't like UT, then you can just ignore this, and
continue to use MSN.xcodeproj file.

 * If you wanna use UT, and there's a pretty good project can help you to simple the job you need to do - gh-unit project. about detail of this project, just google it.

 * Use MSN.with.UT.xcodeproj as your project, you can select "Tests" as your active target when you want to
do some UT job.

 * As an example to indicate how to use this funny framework, ZwpResponseParser_Test.m is a not very good but 
enough beginning.
