	// puts the origin in the upper-left corner. For the sake of brevity (and because
	// it likely would go unnoticed for the image that I'm using) this is not addressed here.
	// For the demonstration of PDF drawing however, it is addressed, as it would definately
	// be noticed, and one method of addressing it is shown there.

	// filling the entire view, we'll clip the view to the rect below. This rect extends
	// past the region of the view, but since the view's rectangle has already been applied as a clip
	// to our drawing area, it will be intersected with this rect to form the final clipping area
	CGContextClipToRect(context, CGRectMake(0.0, 80.0, bounds.size.width, bounds.size.height));
	// The origin of the image rect works similarly to the phase parameter for SetLineDash and
