AppPrefs

Demonstrates how to display your app's preferences or settings in the "Settings" system application.  A settings bundle, included in your applicationâ€™s bundle directory, contains the information needed by the Settings application to display your preferences and make it possible for the user to modify them. It then saves any configured values in the defaults database so that your application can retrieve them at runtime. 

This sample offers an Xcode project already pre-configured to build your Settings bundle as a target.  To customize your settings UI, change the Root.plist file.


Build Requirements
Mac OS X 10.5.3 or later, Xcode 3.1 or later, iPhone OS 2.0 or later.


Runtime Requirements
Mac OS X 10.5.3 or later, iPhone OS 2.0 or later.


Using the Sample
Launch the AppPrefs project using Xcode 3.1.  Make sure the project's current target is set to "AppPrefs".  Build and run the "AppPrefs" target.

To run in the simulator, set the Active SDK to Simulator. To run on a device, set the Active SDK to the appropriate Device setting.  When launched notice the text, its color and the view's background color.  Quit the application and launch "Settings".  At the end of the settings list you will find a section for "AppPrefs".  From there you can set the first and last name, its color and the app's background color.  Quit Settings and return to AppPrefs and notice the settings have changed.
