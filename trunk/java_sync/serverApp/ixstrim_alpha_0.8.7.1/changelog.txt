--------alpha 0.8.5.0--------
1)Bug found and fixed - when client send some requests together
    without waiting response, then server behavior was incorrect,
    server send data without headers etc. And this bug discover
    only if Callback.close() method called in dispatch time
    and data length more than output buff size.
    !!! Attention - this fix can decrease performance
    (but after light test decreasing not found)
