Installing Lulu's JMUD on Ubuntu

If you run into problems fire me a gmail: cwmaguire

What you'll Need:

- Sun's Java SDK or JRE
- Java IDE (e.g. Netbeans) if installing from source
- JMUD source or class files
- MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver
- My SQL Database Server

Step One: Install the Java Runtime

In Synaptic Package Manager search for and install: 
  1) Sun Java SDK
  2) Sun Java JRE

Step Two: Obtaining Lulu-JMUD

Method One: Installing from the Source

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest source .zip file
Create a project called "jmud" (case matters?) in your Java IDE of choice
Unzip the source files into that project's source directory
Compile the source

Method Two: Installing from .Class files

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest binary .zip file
Unzip the class files into a directory

Step Three: Install MySQL

In Synaptic Package Manager search for and install: 
  3) mysql-server-5.0
  4) mysql-client-5.0
  5) libmysql-java
  6) mysql-admin  (I think this is the name of the graphical utility, very handy)

Step Four: Create the JMUD Database

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest database backup .zip file (DB-BAK)

1) run "mysql -uroot -p<your password>"
2) at the mysql prompt (mysql>) run "create database jmud"
3) quit mysql (type "quit" and hit [Enter])
4) run "mysql -uroot -p<your password> -Djmud < <fullpath to backup sql file>"

   e.g. you@yourcomputer:/>mysql -uroot -pMyPassword -Djmud < /home/you/jmud_backup.sql

Step Six: Start the server

Open a terminal: 
cd to the directory where you put or compiled the class files/jar
If you have classes run the following command: java jmud
If you have a jar run: java -jar jmud.jar

Step Seven: Create a login

You can create a new login for yourself in the database or just use one that I've already created. 
Logins can be found in the tblPlayers table
open a terminal and run mysql: mysql -uroot -pMyPassword 
type: use jmud; [enter]
type: select vchPlayerLogin, vchPlayerPassword from tblPlayers; [enter]

Step Seven: Connect to the Server

Open *another* terminal (in Ubuntu's default terminal I can hit Ctrl+t to open a new terminal in new tab)
Run this command: telnet localhost 9000

Login with the login and password found in tblPlayers (e.g. l[enter]q[enter])

If you cannot connect you may need to open port 23 on your firewall.
