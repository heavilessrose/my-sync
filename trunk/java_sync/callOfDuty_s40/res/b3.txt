The Volga River is the lifeblood of Russia. It runs past Stalingrad, which will be your entry point for this mission.  The Axis troops are holding this channel with ferocity as it leads right to the heart of the city.  Many have tried to make this journey, many have failed.  You must succeed.~ ~Recommended Squad: Infantry, Sniper, Medic
