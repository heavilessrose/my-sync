During the invasion some of the Allies were taken by the retreating Axis forces.  Your job is to free them; they hold very important information that could ruin operations in Europe.  You must infiltrate the enemy P.O.W. Camp, take out as many Axis troops as possible, then get to the rendezvous point.~ ~Recommended Squad: Infantry, Sniper, Medic
