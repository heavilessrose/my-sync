Description
===========
JSch is a pure Java implementation of SSH2.  This archive includes
JSch for J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0.  For usages of JSch, please visit at
its homepage(http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/).
This software requires BouncyCastle Crypto API(http://www.bouncycastle.org/).


Features
========
* JSch for J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0 is in pure Java.  It is know to work with:
  o J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0 with BouncyCastle Crypto API(http://www.bouncycastle.org/)
* SSH2 protocol support.
* Key exchange: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1, diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
* Cipher: blowfish-cbc,3des-cbc
* MAC: hmac-md5,hmac-md5-96,hmac-sha1,hmac-sha1-96
* Host key type: ssh-dss, ssh-rsa
* Userauth: password
* Userauth: publickey(DSA,RSA)
* stream forwarding.
* remote exec.
* partial authentication
* JSch for J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0 is licensed under BSD style license
  (refer to LICENSE.txt).


Requirements
============
* J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0
* BouncyCastle Crypto API for J2ME 1.26 or later.
* To compile this stuff, we are using Sun's Wireless Toolkit 2.2.

Obfuscation
===========
The programs using BouncyCastle Crypto API must be obfuscated,
becuase that API includes 'java.security.SecureRandom', 
'java.math.BigInteger', etc., and you will get errors by the security 
check by JavaVM; class name should not be started with 'java'.  
Please note that you have to keep following class names in obfuscation process.

 * com.jcraft.jsch.DHG1
 * com.jcraft.jsch.DHGEX
 * com.jcraft.jsch.bc.*

For example, ProGuard's configuration file('proguard/wtk/default.pro'
included in 'proguard.jar') must include following lines,

-keep class com.jcraft.jsch.DHG1
-keep class com.jcraft.jsch.DHGEX
-keep class com.jcraft.jsch.bc.*

You know that ProGuard is a free Java class file shrinker, optimizer
and obfuscator.  It is licensed under GNU GPL and available at 
http://proguard.sourceforge.net/



Eexample
========
For demonstration, we have ported JCTerm(http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/) to
J2ME/CLDC/MIDP 2.0. The source code is available at 
  http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/ 
and jad and jar files are available on http://j2me.jsch.org/ .
