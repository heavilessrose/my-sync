Yahoo image search client.

UPDATE: 
The value of "filesize" changed from a number to a string in the search response XML. This causes older clients to fail when converting the file size into a number. Please update to the latest version.
The source code is now available. The source code will work as-is. I could not include the images because of copyrights and you will need to get your own Yahoo Image Search Application ID.
This version is for the Nokia E61 and Nokia N70. It should work on any other high-end S60 device.

Features:
*Image thumbnails
*Image full-screen previews
*Save full size images directly to mobile 

Howtos:

To toggle the adult filter, type 'f' in the search box. Wait 2 seconds and a search result that allows you to toggle the filter will appear. Select the search result to toggle the filter on or off.
