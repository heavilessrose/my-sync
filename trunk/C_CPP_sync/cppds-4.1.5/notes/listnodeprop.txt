operations that can be done on a list node:
-- taken from listprop.txt

1.      Adding a list node (sub-list)
1.3       Adding next to a list node
1.4       Adding previous to a list node

2.      Retrieving a list item
2.3       Retrieving from an arbitrary position in the list

3.      Moving
3.1     Moving forward (head to tail) -- 1 increment
3.2     Moving backward (tail to head) -- 1 increment

4       Detaching a list node (sub-list)
4.3       Detaching from an arbitrary position range in the list
          (from x position to y position, toward head or tail)

5.      Searching for a list item
5.1       Searching in linear fashion
5.1.3       reporting search results in list position index, node address,
            item address or boolean status (found, not found)

7.      Applying an operation on a list item
7.1       Applying an operation on one item
7.1.1       Updating
7.1.1.1       Updating item in list at arbitrary position with another item

8.      Replacing a list node (sub-list)
8.1     Steps 9 then Steps 1

9.      Deleting an list node (sub-list)
9.1     Steps 4 then Step 11 with sub-list

10.     Retrieving a list node (sub-list)
10.3       Retrieving from an arbitrary position range in the list
           (from x position to y position, toward head or tail)

11.     Destroy whole list
11.1    Steps 7.1 with Steps 4 and delete function

12.     Duplicating a list item
12.1    Steps 1 with identical list item

12    Converting a list into an array of objects
13    Converting a list into an array of pointers
14    Converting an array of objects into a list
15    Converting an array of pointers into a list
19    Cloning a new identical list from an existing list

// List properties
1.      List empty (0 items in list)            N/A
2.      List full (Reach capacity limit)        always true
3.      Number of items in list                 always 1
4.      Capacity limit of list                  always 1
5.      List circular                           true if detached
6.      List linear                             true if connected

// Operations on list properties
1.      Making list circular
2.      Making list linear
