The main programming interface is the CFNetwork framework, which builds on top of BSD sockets and opaque types in the Core Foundation framework to communicate with network entities.

You can also use the NSStream classes in the Foundation framework and the low-level BSD sockets found in the Core OS layer of the system.

Using Wi-Fi
If your application accesses the network using the Wi-Fi radios, you must notify the system of that fact by including the UIRequiresPersistentWiFi key in the applicationâ€™s Info.plist file.
