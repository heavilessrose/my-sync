If your application creates large data files, or files that change frequently, you should consider storing them in the Application Home/Library/Caches directory and not in the <Application_Home>/Documents directory. Backing up large data files can slow down the backup process significantly. The same is true for files that change regularly (and therefore must be backed up frequently). Placing these files in the Caches directory prevents them from being backed up (in iPhone OS 2.2 and later) during every sync operation.

HFS File Tyoes:

The NSFileManager class provides methods for setting and getting the attributes of documents, including HFS type and creator codes. 

NSFileManager enables you to perform many generic file-system operations. 

NSFileHandle objects provide an object-oriented wrapper for accessing open files or communications channels.

You can use other Cocoa methods for reading from and writing to files—NSFileManager’s contentsAtPath: and NSData’s writeToFile:options:error: are but a couple of examples.
More advantages:
An NSFileHandle is an object that represents an open file or communications channel. It enables programs to read data from or write data to the represented file or channel.
