HFS File Tyoes:

The NSFileManager class provides methods for setting and getting the attributes of documents, including HFS type and creator codes. 

NSFileManager enables you to perform many generic file-system operations. 

NSFileHandle objects provide an object-oriented wrapper for accessing open files or communications channels.

You can use other Cocoa methods for reading from and writing to files—NSFileManager’s contentsAtPath: and NSData’s writeToFile:options:error: are but a couple of examples.
More advantages:
An NSFileHandle is an object that represents an open file or communications channel. It enables programs to read data from or write data to the represented file or channel.
