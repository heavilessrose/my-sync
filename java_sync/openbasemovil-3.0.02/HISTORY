The first release of OpenBaseMovil comes from the commercial framework created
by Elondra: BaseMovil. We have decided to keep version numbers accordingly, so
the first release is the 3.0.
================================================================================

History:
================================================================================

OpenBaseMovil 3.0.02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bug fixes:
- Database: fixed bug 1887883. When creating a table, misses to add the tables
    status to the memory structures, which makes the database fail the first
    time. If the database is restarted it works fine. The bug has been fixed and
    now it works without having to restart the database.
- IndexInfo: fixed bug 1887906. When creating an IndexInfo structure, the order
    was not checked, so the user could pass an invalid value that will make the
    index fail. A new constant MIN_ORDER and proper checinkg have been
    introduced.

OpenBaseMovil 3.0 final
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 3.0 RC3:

* Improvements and changes:

- Added: application template for easy application creation (app-template)
- Added: sample application (PasswordKeeper) based on the application template
- Added: BaseController to openbasemovil-ui, this class should be subclassed by
    actual controllers as it performs some useful tasks such as automatic menu
    navigation and error handling.
- Added: method addColumn suited to String columns to Table
- Added: missing javadoc for Database and Table

* Bug fixes:
- Fixed: spaces and line wraps are now processed correctly in the files
    properties of resource packer and view compiler
- Fixed: device id initialization at LoginInfo
- Fixed: version major for databases intilizes now to 0
- Fixed: Database drop method now allows to drop incomplete or damaged databases
- Fixed: Database setVersionMajor and setVersionMinor are now public and make
    persistent changes when invoked
- Fixed: addColumn method checks for Table, so you can not add String columns
    with methods that do not support String type.

OpenBaseMovil 3.0 RC3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 3.0 RC2:

* Improvements and changes:

- BluetoothDriver, FlicReader, GpsInfo and GpsReader have been moved from util
to bluetooth library.

- StringTokenizer has been moved from util library (package bm.util) to core
library (package bm.core.tools).

- Improved the build system. Now all library versions are centralized in a
single properties file (versions.property) and all dependencies in the build
files take version numbers from there, so when a library changes it's release
number the depending libraries take the correct version number.

* Bug Fixes:

- Table: fixed bug 1874552, table does not create the index for the built-in
primary key

- Fixed bug 1874622 that made the build system not to generate the binary file
for openbasemovi-script.

OpenBaseMovil 3.0 RC2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first COMPLETE version of the framework, which includes all the
needed libraries and tools to create great enterprise class J2ME applications.

Changes from 3.0 RC1:
- Added: openbasemovil-comm 1.0
This is an abstraction layer over COM ports to be able to interact with them no
matter if they are bluetooth, serial or other COM port classes, or even if you
are running the software on other platforms that need native libraries (such
as Windows Mobile)

- Added: openbasemovil-bluetooth 1.0
This library has some utiltiy methods to discover and interact with bluetooth
peripherals, as well as two views that you can directly use to search and select
bluetooth devices and services. It defines a Bluetooth comm port.

- Added: openbasemovil-net 3.0
This is the network abstraction layer. It performs communications through the
use of "Bindings" and provides an HttpBinding to use the phone http connection.
This Binding architecture provides a very flexible and simple way to communicate
with remote services or to even host a "mini-server" in the application.
One of the reasons for this architecture is the future project to provide a
Bluetooth binding that will communicate to a bluetooth proxy program hosted on
a computer so the phone can connect seamlesly to the network through the computer's
connection.
It also contains an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework.

- Added: openbasemovil-ui 2.0
This is the user interface library, that let's you define your application views
using an XML file. The XML file is then compiled to a binary, optimized format
that you can then use from within your application.
It has many useful data aware views, such as forms and "list browsers" that let
you create, edit and navigate through data with just a few lines of code.
The views perform all the bindings and transformations to show what you have
defined in the XML.

- Added: openbasemovil-util 1.0
This library contains some useful resources:
	* ApplicationState: this is a persistent store for application state.
          Not every phone handles incomming calls friendly, so this helps you
          to detect a "forced" exit and restore application state.
	* BluetoothDriver: this is a base class to connect to bluetooth devices
          like GPS antennas or barcode scanners.
        * FlicReader: the driver for the Microvision Flic bluetooth barcode
          scanner.
        * GpsReader: a driver for any NMEA compatible bluetooth GPS antenna,
          that will send you events with positioning from the GPS device.
        * IndexResourceProvider: a provider for the core library ResourceManager
          that uses indexes instead of property files. You an build this kind of
          files with the already released resource-packer.
	* StringTokenizer: a replacement for this JavaSE missing class.
	* Util: a static class with some useful methods.

- Added: openbasemovil-viewcompiler
This is the command line tool and Ant task that converts the XML view definitions
into it's binary optimized form.

- Added: dependencies: some of the Jakarta Common libraries for the viewcompiler.

- modified: build.xml for the project so it includes this new libraries.

OpenBaseMovil 3.0 RC1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first "almost complete" version of the framework, it lacks the ui
library and some tools for the complete build process. Those are to be included
int RC2.
We've called it RC1 because of this lack of the ui library and because we have
added some methods and made some changes in the database engine so it can work
in standalone mode. As opposed to the commercial version which always is created
and populated over the air with the sync engine.
But you can consider it really stable and spect minor changes in the following
releases.
We expect to release an RC2 with ui, tools, and probably some more libraries,
and then the final 3.0.

This version includes:
- openbasemovil-commenter
A command line tool and Ant Task that preprocesses source files commenting out
lines with given patterns. It is used to absolutely strip logging from
production version of libraries and programs (to reduce size and increase speed)

- openbasemovil-core 2.0.1
The core library which has the classes that support all of the infrastructure.
It depends in no other, and all the rest depend on it.

- openbasemovil-script 0.1
The scripting library, currently can be considered standalone and only depends
on openbasemovil-core.

- openbasemovil-errorlog 3.0
This is a persistent errorlog implementation. We are considering to remove it
since it's main purpose in the commercial version is to track and send errors
that might happen.

- openbasemovil-storage 3.0
This is an abstraction layer over the actual RMS, so the database engine only
thinks in terms of Stores and records.
It performs several important tasks, such as record multiplexing and much more
in the upcomming 4.0 release.

- openbasemovil-db 3.0.1 RC1
The database library. This is the relational database engine.
This version has no SQL support yet, and has an incomplete implementation of the
scripting bindings (to use the database from the scripting engine).

- openbasemovil-logimpl-console 1.0
Implementation of the Log class that sends output to the console. This is used
to build the debug version of applications, so you can see the log in the
console.

- openbasemovil-resource-pack
A command line tool and Ant Task that consolidates multiple resource boundles
into one single boundle, checking that all resources are present in all the
languages detected.
Can also be used to check that a single resource boundle has no missing
resources.
It is compiled in two flavors, one of them can conly generate properties files
for the resources. This one is used along the libraries to check that no
resources are missing, since it has no dependencies on any of them.
The second flavor uses the core and db libraries and is able to output the
resources also as a binary file in the form of a btree index.
This version is for applications.
