The air assaults on Berlin are proving very costly and losses are running at 6-7 percent per mission.  The city has taken a huge amount of damage but there are still many troops on the ground.  You and your squad have been assigned to move in and take out as many troops as you can.  Once you have reached the extraction point wait for further orders.~ ~Recommended Squad: Infantry, Engineer, Commando
