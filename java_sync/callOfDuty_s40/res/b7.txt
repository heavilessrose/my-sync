The V2 Rocket is an unmanned, guided ballistic missile with a range of 200 miles.  It has the firepower to flatten a city block.  With these weapons the Axis troops can attack us from almost anywhere they please, and there is nothing we can do.  They need to be removed.  Your mission is to infiltrate the launch sites and destroy them.~ ~Recommended Squad: Infantry, Engineer, Medic
