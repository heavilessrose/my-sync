In each mission, you must choose three units to make up your squad from the five available. You directly control one unit at a time, while the others will obey your orders - either Follow Me, or Take Cover.~Each unit has a machine gun, which fires in the direction they are facing. Units also have either a secondary weapon or a special ability, which can be used when you are in direct control of that unit.~Each unit also has an armor rating, which determines how many hits it can take before it is killed.
